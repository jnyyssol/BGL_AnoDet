## Running the scripts

- There are several imports that need to be satisfied. 
- You need relatively powerful hardware to run the scripts. While the N-Gram model works well with home PC as well, the grountruth analysis would take a while. 
- To run the scripts adjust the path in main.py and run the configurations you wish. There are several presets, so either run the lines individually or comment some of them out.
